# /kolshek:init

You are running the KolShek initialization skill. Your job is to get the user's financial data flowing — providers connected, transactions fetched, translated, and categorized.

## Before You Start

Read `references/cli-reference.md` for the complete command reference, DB schema, exit codes, and SQL patterns.

## Step 1: Check CLI

Run `command -v kolshek` (or `which kolshek`) to verify the CLI is installed. If not found:

> KolShek CLI not found. Install it first, then run `/kolshek:init` again.

Stop here if not installed.

## Step 2: Check Providers

Run `kolshek providers list --json` to check if providers are configured.

The response includes an `authenticated` field per provider and an `alias` field (providers can have multiple instances of the same bank/card with different aliases, e.g., `leumi-personal`, `leumi-joint`).

**If no providers:**

> Your bank/credit card credentials are sensitive. KolShek stores them securely in your OS keychain — they never touch disk or logs.
>
> Please run this in your terminal:
> ```
> kolshek providers add
> ```
> You can add multiple providers in one go — the wizard will ask if you want to add more after each one.
> Let me know when you're done.

Wait for the user to confirm. Run `kolshek providers list --json` again to verify at least one provider exists. If still none, repeat.

**If providers exist:**

Show what's connected (name, alias, auth status). If any show `authenticated: false`, tell the user:

> Some providers need re-authentication. Run `kolshek providers auth <id>` in your terminal to update credentials.

Ask if they want to add more before continuing.

## Step 3: Fetch Transactions

Run `kolshek transactions list --limit 1 --json` to check if there's existing data.

**If no transactions yet**, run the first fetch:

> Fetching your transaction history. Each provider has its own max range (typically up to a year). This may take a few minutes...

Run: `kolshek fetch --json`

The response includes `scrapeStartDate` and `scrapeEndDate` per provider — use these to report the actual date range fetched.

Handle exit codes:
- **0:** Report success — transactions fetched, date range per provider.
- **3:** Credentials expired — tell user to run `kolshek providers auth <id>` to re-authenticate, then retry.
- **4:** Timeout — retry with `--from 180d`, then `--from 90d`.
- **5:** Bank blocking — inform user, suggest trying later.
- **10:** Partial success — report what worked and what failed. Offer to retry failed providers individually (e.g., `kolshek fetch leumi-joint --json`).

**If transactions already exist**, show a quick count and date range, then ask if they want to fetch fresh data. If yes, run `kolshek fetch --json`.

## Step 4: Translations

Ask the user:

> Many Israeli transaction descriptions are in Hebrew. Would you like to set up English translations?

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Yes, translate them** — I'll generate translations for all your merchants (recommended)
- **Skip for now** — Keep original Hebrew descriptions

If they choose to translate, run `/kolshek:translate`. It handles dictionary seeding, Hebrew→English translation, user review, rule creation, and application. When it completes, continue to the next step.

## Step 5: Categorization & Classifications

Ask the user:

> Would you like to categorize your transactions? This covers both expenses (groceries, restaurants, bills) and income (salary, freelance, refunds), plus setting up classifications so reports know what to exclude (CC billing, transfers, etc.).

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Auto-categorize** — I'll analyze your transactions and suggest category rules (recommended)
- **Skip for now** — Categorize later

If they choose auto-categorize, run `/kolshek:categorize`. It handles transaction analysis, CC billing / internal transfer detection, category suggestions, rule creation, classification setup, and application. When it completes, continue to the next step.

## Step 6: Schedule Auto-Fetch

Ask the user:

> Would you like to automatically fetch new transactions on a schedule?

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Every 12 hours** — Keeps data fresh throughout the day (recommended)
- **Every 24 hours** — Once a day is enough
- **Skip** — I'll fetch manually when needed

If they choose a schedule, run `kolshek schedule set --every <interval> --json`. Report the next estimated run time.

## Step 7: Summary

Run `kolshek providers list --json` and `kolshek accounts --json`.

Present:

> **Setup complete!**
>
> - **Providers:** N connected (Bank Hapoalim, Isracard, ...)
> - **Accounts:** N accounts
> - **Transactions:** N total (earliest: YYYY-MM-DD)
> - **Translations:** N rules applied / skipped
> - **Categories:** N rules applied / skipped
> - **Classifications:** N categories classified (expense/income/cc_billing/transfer/...)
> - **Auto-fetch:** every Xh / not scheduled
>
> **What's next?**
> - `/kolshek:analyze` — Deep-dive financial analysis with budget targets
> - `/kolshek:categorize` — Update category rules
> - `/kolshek:translate` — Update translation rules
> - Or just ask me anything about your finances.
